/**
 * An <i>IfcObjectDefinition</i> is the generalization of any semantically treated thing or process, either being a type
 * or an occurrences. Object defintions can be named, using the inherited <i>Name</i> attribute, which should be a user
 * recognizable label for the object occurrence. Further explanations to the object can be given using the inherited
 * <i>Description</i> attribute.&nbsp;</p>
 * <p>Objects are independent pieces
 * of information that might contain or reference other pieces of information. There are three essential kinds of
 * relationships in which object definitions (by their instantiable subtypes) can be involved:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Assignment
 * of other objects</b> - an assignment
 * relationship (<i>IfcRelAssigns</i>) that
 * refers to other types of objects and creates a bi-directional
 * association. The semantic of the assignment is established at the level
 * of the subtypes of the general <i>IfcRelAssigns</i>
 * relationship. There is no dependency implied a priori by the assignment.</li>
 *   <li><b>Association
 * to external resources</b> - an
 * association relationship (<i>IfcRelAssociates</i>)
 * that refers to external sources of information (most notably a
 * classification
 * or document) and creates a uni-directional association. There is no
 * dependency implied by the association.</li>
 *   <li><b>Aggregation
 * of other objects</b> - an
 * aggregation relationship (<i>IfcRelDecomposes</i>)
 * that establishes a whole/part relation and creates a bi-directional
 * relation. There is an implied dependency established.</li>
 * </ul>
