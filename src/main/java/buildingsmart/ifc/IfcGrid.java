     * Creates a new IfcProduct, using the provided globalId.
     *
     * @param globalId        Assignment of a globally unique identifier
     *                        within the
     *                        entire software world.
     * @param ownerHistory    Assignment of the information about the current
     *                        ownership of that object, including owning actor,
     *                        application, local identification and information
     *                        captured about the recent changes of the
     *                        object, NOTE:
     *                        only the last modification in stored.
     * @param name            Optional name for use by the participating
     *                        software
     *                        systems or users. For some subtypes of IfcRoot the
     *                        insertion of the Name attribute may be required
     *                        . This
     *                        would be enforced by a where rule.
     * @param description     Optional description, provided for exchanging
     *                        informative comments.
     * @param objectType      The type denotes a particular type that
     *                        indicates the
     *                        object further. The use has to be established
     *                        at the
     *                        level of instantiable subtypes. In particular
     *                        it holds
     *                        the user defined type, if the enumeration of the
     *                        attribute PredefinedType is set to USERDEFINED.
     * @param objectPlacement Placement of the product in space, the
     *                        placement can
     *                        either be absolute (relative to the world
     *                        coordinate
     *                        system), relative (relative to the object
     *                        placement of
     *                        another product), or constraint (e.g. relative
     *                        to grid
     *                        axes). It is determined by the various subtypes of
     *                        IfcObjectPlacement, which includes the axis
     *                        placement
     *                        information to determine the transformation for
     *                        the
     *                        object coordinate system.
     * @param representation  Reference to the representations of the
     *                        product, being
     *                        either a representation
     *                        (IfcProductRepresentation) or
     *                        as a special case a shape representations
     *                        (IfcProductDefinitionShape). The product
     *                        definition
     *                        shape provides for multiple geometric
     *                        representations
     *                        of the shape property of the object within the

     *                        object coordinate system, defined by the object
     *                        placement.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If globalId or ownerHistory are null; if
     *                                  globalId was used in another instance of
