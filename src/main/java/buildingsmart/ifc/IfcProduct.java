/**
 * Any object, or any aid to define, organize and annotate an object, that
 * relates to a geometric or spatial context. Subtypes of <i>IfcProduct</i>
 * usually hold a shape representation and a local placement within the project
 * structure. </p>
 * <p>This includes manufactured, supplied or created objects
 * (referred to as elements) for incorporation into an AEC/FM project. This also
 * includes objects that are created indirectly by other products, as spaces are
 * defined by bounding elements. Products can be designated for permanent use or
 * temporary use, an example for the latter is formwork. Products are defined by
 * their properties and representations.</p>
 * <p>In addition to physical products (covered by the subtype
 * <i>IfcElement</i>)
 * and spatial items (covered by the subtype <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i>)
 * the <i>IfcProduct</i> also includes non-physical items, that relate to a
 * geometric or spatial contexts, such as grid, port, annotation, structural
 * actions, etc.</p>
 * <p><b>Use Definition</b></p>
 * <p>Any instance of <i>IfcProduct</i> defines a
 * particular occurrence of a product, the common type information, that relates
 * to many similar (or identical) occurrences of <i>IfcProduct</i>, is handled
 * by the <i>IfcTypeProduct</i> (and its subtypes), assigned to one or many
 * occurrences of <i>IfcProduct</i> by using the objectified relationship
 * <i>IfcRelDefinesByType</i>. The <i>IfcTypeProduct</i> may provide, in
 * addition to common properties, also a common geometric representation for all
 * occurrences.</p>
 * <p>An <i>IfcProduct</i> occurs at a specific
 * location in space if it has a geometric representation assigned. It can be
 * placed relatively to other products, but ultimately relative to the world
 * coordinate system defined for this project.</p>
 * <p>The inherited <i>ObjectType</i> attribute can be
 * used to designate a particular type of the product instance. If subtypes of
 * <i>IfcProduct</i> have a <i>PredefinedType</i> defined, the
 * <i>ObjectType</i>
 * is used to provide the user defined, particular type of the product instance,
 * if the
 * <i>PredefinedType</i>
 * is set to <font size="-1">USERDEFINED</font>.</p>
