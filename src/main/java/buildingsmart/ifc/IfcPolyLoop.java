/**
 * <p>A
 * poly loop is a loop with straight edges bounding a planar region in space. A
 * poly loop is a loop of genus 1 where the loop is represented by an ordered
 * coplanar collection of points forming the vertices of the loop. The loop is
 * composed of straight line segments joining a point in the collection to the
 * succeeding point in the collection. The closing segment is from the last to
 * the first point in the collection.&nbsp;</p>
 * <p>The direction of the loop is in the direction of the line
 * segments. </p>
 * <blockquote>
 * <small>NOTE &nbsp;This entity
 * exists primarily to facilitate the efficient communication of faceted B-rep
 * models. </small>
 * </blockquote>
 * <p>A poly loop shall conform to the following topological
 * constraints:</p>
 * <dl>
 *   <dd>- the loop has the genus of one.</dd>
 *   <dd>- the following equation shall be satisfied
