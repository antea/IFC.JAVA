/**
 * A plane angle measure is the value of an angle in a plane.
 * <p>
 * Usually measured in radian (rad, m/m = 1), but also grads may be used. The
 * grad unit may be declared as a conversion based unit based on radian unit.
 * <p>
 * <small>NOTE: IfcPlaneAngleMeasure is used where angles need to be described
 * to an accuracy of less than one degree and expressed as decimal parts of an
 * angle. It is widely used for angular measurement except for situations where
 * accuracy needs to be defined using arc measurement; for which purpose the
 * IfcCompoundPlaneAngleMeasure is provided.</small>
