/**
 * <P><U>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</U>: A face is a topological
 * entity of dimensionality 2 corresponding to the intuitive notion of a piece
 * of surface bounded by loops. Its domain, if present, is an oriented,
 * connected, finite 2-manifold in <I>R<SUP>m</SUP></I>. A face domain shall not
 * have handles but it may have holes, each hole bounded by a loop. The domain
 * of the underlying geometry of the face, if present, does not contain its
 * bounds, and 0 &lt; &Xi; &lt; &infin;.</P>
 * <P>A face is represented by its bounding loops, which are defined as face
 * bounds. A face has a topological normal n and the tangent to a loop is t. For
 * a loop bounding a face with defined geometry, the cross product n x t points
 * toward the interior of the face. That is, each loop runs counter-clockwise
 * around the face when viewed from above, if we consider the normal n to point
 * up. With each loop is associated a BOOLEAN flag to signify whether the loop
 * direction is oriented with respect to the face normal (TRUE) or should be
 * reversed (FALSE). </P>
 * <P>A face shall have at least one bound, and the loops shall not
 * intersect. One loop is optionally distinguished as the outer loop of the
 * face. If so, it establishes a preferred way of embedding the face domain in
 * the plane, in which the other bounding loops of the face are inside the outer
 * bound. Because the face domain is arcwise connected, no inner loop will
 * contain any other loop. This is true regardless of which embedding in the
 * plane is chosen.
 * </P>
 * <P>The edges and vertices referenced by the loops of a face form a graph,
 * of which the individual loops are the connected components. </P>
 * <P><U>Informal propositions</U>:</P>
 * <OL>
 * <LI>No edge shall be referenced by the face more than twice. </LI>
 * <LI>Distinct face bounds of the face shall have no common vertices.
 * </LI>
 * <LI>If geometry is present, distinct loops of the same face shall not
 * intersect. </LI>
 * <LI>The face shall satisfy the Euler Equation: (number of vertices) -
 * (number of edges) - (number of loops) + (sum of genus for loops) = 0 .</LI>
 * </OL>
