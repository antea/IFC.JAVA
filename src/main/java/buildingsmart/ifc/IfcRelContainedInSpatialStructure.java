/**
 * This objectified relationship,
 * <i>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</i>, is used to assign
 * elements to a certain level of the spatial project certain level of the
 * spatial structure. The question, which level is relevant for which type of
 * element, can only be answered within the context of a particular project and
 * might vary within the various regions.
 * </p>
 * <blockquote>
 * <p>
 * <small>EXAMPLE A multi-storey space is contained (or
 * belongs to) the building storey at which its ground level is, but it is
 * referenced by all the other building storeys, in which it spans. A lift shaft
 * might be contained by the basement, but referenced by all storeys, through
 * which it spans.</small>
 * </p>
 * </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * The containment relationship of an element within a spatial structure has to
 * be a hierarchical relationship, an element can only be contained within a
 * single spatial structure element. The reference relationship between an
 * element and the spatial structure may not be hierarchical, i.e. an element
 * can reference many spatial structure elements.
 * </p>
 * <blockquote>
 * <p>
 * <small>NOTE The reference relationship is expressed by
 * <i>IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure</i>.</small>
 * </p>
 * </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Predefined spatial structure elements to which elements can be assigned are
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>site as <i>IfcSite</i>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>building as <i>IfcBuilding</i>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>storey as <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>space as <i>IfcSpace</i>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 *   Occurrences of the same element type can be assigned to
 *   different spatial structure elements depending on the
 *   context of the occurrence.
